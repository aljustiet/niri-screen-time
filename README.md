# Niri Screen Time

A utility that collects information about how much time you spend in each application.

![Report Example](https://github.com/probeldev/niri-screen-time/blob/main/screenshots/report.png?raw=true)


## Support Wayland compositor:

Niri

Hyprland

## Installation

### go 

```bash
go install github.com/probeldev/niri-screen-time@latest
```

If you get an error claiming that niri-screen-time cannot be found or is not defined, you
may need to add `~/go/bin` to your $PATH 

Zsh

```bash
echo "export PATH=\$PATH:~/go/bin" >> ~/.zshrc
```

Bash

```bash
echo "export PATH=\$PATH:~/go/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
```

### nix 

```bash 
nix profile install github:probeldev/niri-screen-time
```

## Usage 

Daemon â€” a background service that collects data on application usage time (requires adding to startup for proper operation).

Start the daemon:

```bash
niri-screen-time -daemon 
```

View data (default: today's data):

```bash
niri-screen-time 
```

View data from a selected date until today:
  
```bash
niri-screen-time -from=2023-10-20
```

View data within a date range:

```bash
niri-screen-time -from=2023-10-01 -to=2023-10-31 
```


## Subroutine and Website Configuration

To track specific websites or console commands within applications, use the configuration file:

**Location:**  
`~/.config/niri-screen-time/subprograms.json`

### Configuration Format
```json
[
  {
    "app_id": "application_identifier",
    "title": "partial_window_title",
    "alias": "display_name"
  }
]

```

### Configuration Examples

For terminal commands:

```json
{
  "app_id": "com.mitchellh.ghostty",
  "title": "nvim",
  "alias": "NeoVim Editor"
}
```

For websites in browser:

```json
{
  "app_id": "org.mozilla.firefox",
  "title": "GitHub",
  "alias": "GitHub"
}
```

### How It Works:

The system checks if the title is contained in the window title

Case insensitive

When matched: adds the specified alias in parentheses to the app ID

If the app is in the list but the title doesn't match: adds (Other)

The config file is automatically created with examples on first launch

## Application Alias Configuration

To display custom application names in reports, you can configure aliases in the config file.
The system checks for partial matches (if the name is contained in the application title).

### Configuration File

**Location:**  

```
~/.config/niri-screen-time/alias.json
```

### Configuration Format

```json
[
  {
    "name": "original_application_name",
    "alias": "custom_display_name"
  },
  {
    "name": "org.telegram.desktop",
    "alias": "Telegram"
  }
]
```
